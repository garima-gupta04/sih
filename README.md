## **1. Proposed Solution**

An **AI-driven CCTV surveillance system** designed specifically for classrooms, capable of:

* Detecting **teacher presence/absence** in real time.
* Monitoring and flagging **inappropriate teacher or student behavior**.
* Identifying incidents like **bullying, theft, harassment, or violence**.
* Generating **daily and monthly reports** on teacher and student conduct.
* Sending **instant alerts** to school administrators in case of suspicious or harmful actions.

---

## **2. What Does It Do?**

* **Presence Tracking:** Uses AI vision to check if a teacher is present and engaged in teaching during class hours.
* **Behavior Analysis:** Detects if teachers or students are engaged in inappropriate actions (e.g., sleeping, using mobile phones excessively, shouting aggressively).
* **Incident Detection:** Identifies bullying, theft, or harassment and logs them for administrative review.
* **Automated Alerts:** Sends real-time alerts via email/SMS to the school admin or principal.
* **Data Reporting:** Generates actionable reports for better decision-making.

---

## **3. What Problem Does It Solve?**

* **Reduced motivation among some teachers** to actively teach.
* **Lack of monitoring** in classrooms when admin or inspectors are absent.
* **Bullying & indiscipline** going unnoticed until it escalates.
* **Students picking up bad habits** due to unchecked classroom environment.
* **Limited proof** in case of complaints or disputes between teachers, students, and parents.

---

## **4. Why Is It Different?**

* **AI-driven, not manual** â€“ eliminates the need for constant human monitoring.
* Works **in real-time** with instant flagging instead of reviewing hours of recorded footage.
* Uses **behavior detection models**, not just motion detection.
* Can **differentiate roles** (teacher vs student) for context-aware alerts.
* Provides **actionable insights** instead of raw video.
* Can work **offline with local servers** for data privacy.
